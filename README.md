# can-blazor-make-me-happy

A 'lunch and learn' talk for my friends at work.

## Talking Points

We want to give our customers tools that save them time and give them superpowers.

Part of doing this is to choose a tech stack that we can be effective with.

But effectiveness in WHATEVER stack it is... boils down to our ability to THINK. Problem solving happens in our thoughts. The tools can bring action from our thoughts.

We could say another part of delivering great tools to our customers is making an effort to keep balance in our thoughts to continue at a consistent pace. Forever. Maybe some of you do this effortlessly. This talk has something for you too; thanks for sitting through this part for the rest of us.

If I am unhappy, I have additional thoughts that invade my focus.

When I am happy, and I am having fun I can THINK FASTER.

So how do we spend more time being happy at work?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The ultimate source of happiness is within us. Not money, not power, not status. Some of my friends are billionaires, but they are very unhappy people. Power and money fail to bring inner peace. Outward attainment will not bring real inner joyfulness. We must look inside.</p>&mdash; Dalai Lama (@DalaiLama) <a href="https://twitter.com/DalaiLama/status/1479385216561004548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2022</a></blockquote>

Our team has learned about React. Can anyone remember something that you liked from the React training- or something you did on your own WITH the training?

I suspect that we did not get enough hands-on time to evaluate whether we enjoy using it.
